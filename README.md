# UdemyProject-OmnifoodWebPage

Hi Everyone,

This website is being created as part of an Udemy course [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS - Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3).

This tutorial video only served to master HTML and CSS, containing just a hint of JavaScript.

I have learned a lot during the creation of the site, including:
* Modern, semantic and accessible HTML5
* Modern CSS, including flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
* Important CSS concepts such as the box model, positioning schemes, inheritance, solving selector conflicts, etc.
* How to plan, sketch, design, build, test, and optimize a professional website
* How to make websites work on every possible mobile device (responsive design)
* How to use common components and layout patterns for professional website design and development
* Developer skills such as reading documentation, debugging, and using professional tools
* How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons
